# 🌐 What is the Permaweb Index?

The Permaweb Index is a **crypto index for all fair launch projects on the permaweb**.  
💼 Investors can use this index to gain exposure to a diverse group of dynamically & autonomously managed assets.

## 📊 What assets are in the Permaweb Index?

- 🔺 **33.3% to $AR (Arweave)**
- 🌀 **33.3% to $AO (AO Protocol)**
- 🎯 **33.3% to Fair Launch Projects**

## ⚙️ How are the allocations of fair launch projects managed?

🧠 Autonomous on-chain agents manage the exposure of the Permaweb Index’s assets based on the capital staked to individual projects.

- 🚀 Projects with more manual delegation receive more delegation from the Permaweb Index, increasing that asset's exposure.

## ⏳ When will ArcAO be joining the Permaweb Index?

📢 ArcAO will be **fair launched as a part of the Permaweb Index from day 1** of ArcAO’s token release.

## 🗓️ When will ArcAO’s Token be released?

🎉 ArcAO’s token will **drop before you know it** — stay tuned, keep your 👀 peeled, and 🔔 notifications on!

## 💸 How can ArcAO be invested in?

- 🔄 **Direct Delegation:** For the most upside potential on this asset.
- 📦 **Permaweb Index Exposure:** For moderate exposure with a grouping of other assets.

## 🛎️ How will I know when it's time to delegate?
