# 🚀 What is a Fair Launch Project (FLP)?

A **Fair Launch Project** is exactly what it sounds like—crypto for the people, by the people. No pre-sales. No pre-mines. No secret club of early investors cashing out while you're still figuring out what the project even does.

Instead, FLPs offer an equal playing field where **every participant has the same shot** at getting in early. It’s a Web3 ethos brought to life.

## 💡 Why Fair Launch?

Fair launch projects are gaining serious ground against traditional VC and pre-sale models—and for good reason:

- **Trust**: There’s no hidden agenda or whale dumping risk.
- **Transparency**: Open participation means open accountability.
- **Community**: With aligned incentives, strong communities form organically.

## ⚠️ Are There Risks?

Of course. Like anything worth exploring in crypto, FLPs come with their own flavor of chaos:

- **Price Volatility**: Early stages can be rocky. But let’s be honest—when has crypto *not* been a wild ride?
- **Governance Gaps**: Some projects struggle without a clear roadmap or leadership. That’s why teams like **ArcAO** stand out with strong direction and vision.

## 🔥 Examples of FLP Success

### 🌐 AO (The Computer)
One of the most iconic fair launches in recent memory. <a href={AO.website} target="_blank">AO</a> earned massive traction by focusing on building deep tech and a passionate community over fast cash.

### 💱 Botega
Launched on AO, <a href={BOTEGA.website} target="_blank">Botega</a> is a DEX that took the fair launch playbook and turned it into a high-performance, community-driven exchange.

### 🌌 ArcAO
Soon. (Wen? Soon.)

# 🎯 The Big Picture

Fair Launch Projects flip the script. Instead of a top-down, VC-first structure, they start with *you*. The builders, the traders, the meme lords, the believers.

They’re about creating transparent, community-driven ecosystems where you don’t have to wonder who’s dumping on you.

Because in a true fair launch, **you’re not just early—you’re essential**.
