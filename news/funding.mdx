# How AO Becomes the Number 1 GameFI Chain

ArcAO's imminent fair launch and boosted funds from the permaweb index are poised to **transform <a href={AO.website} target="_blank">AO</a> into the leading GameFi chain.** Here's how this vision unfolds ðŸš€
{/* truncate */}    
## 1. Accelerator-Driven Launches

ArcAO funds early-stage GameFi projects through its <a href={ARCAO.acceleratorProgramSignup} target="_blank">accelerator program</a>. This gets projects off the ground fastâ€”ArcAO benefits from equity, and token holders benefit from growth.

We've already seen the accelerator program perform **perfectly** with successful launches like <a href={RUNEREALM.premiumGameSite} target="_blank">RuneRealm</a> and infrastructure foundations such as <a href={RANDAO.website} target="_blank">RANDAO</a>. Itâ€™s time to **scale** this offering and take the GameFi revolution to the next level!

## 2. Permaweb-Powered Hype Machine â€“ ArcAO Ambassadors

After launch, a WAVE of ArcAO Ambassadors creates and spreads custom content across the permaweb ðŸŒŠ. Every game launched gains viral traction through the <a href={ARCAO.ambassadorProgramSignup} target="_blank">ArcAO Ambassador Program</a>.

Our last wave included **80 dedicated content creators**, carefully vetted from an application pool of **over 500 applicants**! These ambassadors are the **living, breathing hype machine** that will bring GameFi to every corner of the world.

## 3. Compounding Investment Pool
ArcAO keeps a pooled stake in the GameFi projects it accelerates. Profits from winners are reinvested into future projectsâ€”fueling a self-perpetuating GameFi growth engine.
