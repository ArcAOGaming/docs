# AMMs — The Swap Engine Behind the $GAME

Ever wondered how tokens get swapped in DeFi without any human in the middle?  
Meet the **AMM (Automated Market Maker)** — your always-on, math-powered trading buddy.

> ⚡ **TL;DR:** You trade tokens *with a pool*, not a person. The smart contract sets the price and takes a small fee. That's it.

## 🚀 30-Second Tour: How It Actually Works

1. **Pool Party:** Tokens (like `$GAME` & `$AO`) live in a shared pool.  
2. **Math Boss:** A formula (yup, `x * y = k`) calculates prices on the fly.  
3. **No Middlemen:** No need for buyers/sellers to match. The pool handles it.  
4. **Tiny Tolls:** Every swap pays a small fee — powering the protocol.

## 📈 Why Prices Move (The Slippage Shuffle)

- **Constant-Product AMMs** (think Uniswap-style) always keep `x * y = k`.  
- Buy `$GAME` → the pool holds **less `$GAME`** and **more `$AO`** → **`$GAME` gets pricier**.  
- This dynamic = **slippage** (prices shift mid-swap) and **arbitrage** (traders balance AMM prices with the broader market).

> 🧠 Think of the AMM as a *rubber band* — pull hard on one side, the other side stretches.

## 💸 Fees: The Tiny Tolls That Keep Things Running

Fee tiers you’ll often see:

- **0.01%–0.05%** for ultra-liquid or stable swaps  
- **0.30%** — the classic  
- **1.00%+** for exotic or spicy tokens  

These fees are taken **per swap** and routed to the protocol’s stakeholders, treasury, or incentives.  
If you're building pools, fee tiers directly shape **trader costs** and **pool earnings**.
