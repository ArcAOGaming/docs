# Liquidity Providing — Make Swaps Your Side Hustle

If you’ve read about **[AMMs (Super Simple)](/defi/amms)**, you already know how swaps happen.  
Now let’s flip to the other side: **becoming the one who *enables* swaps** and earns fees for it.  

That’s **Liquidity Providing (LP)**. You deposit two tokens (like `$GAME` + `$AO`) into an AMM pool, and in return, you get a cut of every trade.  

It’s like running a tiny, always-on market-making booth… without quitting your day job.  

> ⚡ *TL;DR:* Put tokens in → earn a cut of every trade → let the fees flow.

## 🚀 How LPing Works (At a Glance)

1. **Pick a Pool:** e.g., `$GAME / $AO` with a fee tier (0.05%, 0.30%, 1%+).  
2. **Deposit Equal Value:** Both tokens, 50/50 style.  
3. **Get LP Receipts:** A token or NFT proving your share.  
4. **Traders Swap:** Every trade = fees trickling in.  
5. **Exit Anytime:** Burn your LP receipt to withdraw your share.

## 💸 Where Your Yield Comes From

- **Swap Fees:** Tiny % of every trade. (0.01–0.05%, 0.30%, 1%+ depending on pool).  
- **Incentives (Optional):** Bonus rewards if pools offer them.  
- **Compounding:** Reinvest fees/rewards → snowball into higher APY.  

> 🧠 **Mental Model:** LPing = **short volatility, long volume.**  
> - More swaps = more fees.  
> - Wild price swings = more risk exposure.

## 📊 Fees & Volume (The Fun Part)

- **Fee tier** sets both trader cost *and* your income.  
- **High volume** is king — it drives fee APR.  
- Bigger pools = lower slippage = more trades… but also more LPs sharing fees.  

**Rule of Thumb:** A healthy pool = strong daily volume relative to TVL.

## ⚠️ Impermanent Loss (IL) — The Core LP Risk

When prices drift apart, the AMM rebalances your tokens.  
Sometimes, you’d have been richer just holding. That’s IL.  

- **Lower IL:** Stable/pegged pairs.  
- **Higher IL:** Volatile, uncorrelated pairs.  

> ✏️ **Quick intuition:** If one token 2×’s vs the other, a 50/50 LP under constant-product rules loses ~5–6% vs HODL (before fees). Strong fees may offset this… but not guaranteed.

**Mitigations:**  
- Start with correlated pairs.  
- Match fee tier to volatility.  
- Don’t chase unsustainable yields.  
- Monitor pool health & divergence.

## 🔢 Simple Walkthrough (Numbers Time)

You LP with **$1,000 `$GAME` + $1,000 `$AO`** in a **0.30% pool**.  
- Pool processes **$500,000** in swaps in a week.  
- Fees = **$1,500** total.  
- Your 2% share = **$30 fees** for that week.  
- Final PnL depends on `$GAME` vs `$AO` price movement (IL could subtract, fees could outpace it).

---

## 🎟 What You Actually Hold

- **LP Tokens (v2-style):** Fungible ERC-20 share of the pool.  
- **NFT LP Positions (v3-style):** Define your price range. In-range = higher fee yield; out-of-range = nada.  

> 📌 Always check pool docs for fee claiming + incentive options.

## ✅ Best-Practice Checklist

- Start **small** — learn UX & risks first.  
- Prefer **high-volume, sensible-fee** pools.  
- Track **volume, fees, price moves** regularly.  
- Harvest/compound on a **gas-friendly cadence**.  
- ⚠️ Avoid unaudited “degen” farms unless you’re comfortable with full risk.  
- ⚠️ Don’t overexpose to one pool/protocol. Diversify.

- **Fee Tier:** Swap cost setting (0.05%, 0.30%, etc.).  
- **IL:** Impermanent Loss = underperformance vs HODL.  
- **TVL:** Total Value Locked in a pool/protocol.
