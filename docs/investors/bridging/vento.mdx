# 🌉 How to Bridge USDC → vUSDC via VentoSwap

You can bridge your **USDC from Ethereum** into **vUSDC on the AO (Arweave) network** using VentoSwap's bridge tool. Here's how:

## 🔎 1. What Is VentoSwap?

**VentoSwap** offers a bridge that enables users to convert assets—such as **USDC and AR**—into their corresponding AO-native versions, **vUSDC** and **vAR**, respectively.  
Although details on the site are limited, the feature is officially confirmed on VentoSwap’s social channels.

### 2️⃣ Step 2: Connect Your Wallet
You will need **two wallets** for the bridging process:

- 🔑 An **Ethereum wallet** (such as MetaMask) to send and lock your USDC on Ethereum.  
- 💼 An **AO wallet** (such as Wander Wallet) to receive your bridged tokens (**vUSDC**) on the AO network.  

Connect both wallets to the VentoSwap interface before proceeding.
