# 💎 $GAME Catalyst

The **$GAME Catalyst** is your ticket into Arc’s liquidity engine.  
It represents a share of liquidity in pools like **Permaswap** or **Botega**, which generate LP yield over time from trading volume.  

> ⚡ Before diving in, make sure you understand the **[risks of Liquidity Providing](/docs/basics/defi/liquidity-providing.mdx)**.

## 🔑 How It Works

1. **LP-Backed Tokens** — $GAME Catalyst tokens = your proportional share of an LP position.  
2. **Yield Generation** — As swaps happen, fees accumulate, boosting the value of your Catalyst position.  
3. **Automated Buybacks** — Revenue from Arc **$GAMES** (like <a href={RUNEREALM.website} target="_blank">RuneRealm Onchain</a>) — paid in `$AO`, `$AR`, or `$USDC` — is funneled back into $GAME via automated **½ buybacks + liquidity pairing**.  
4. **Ecosystem Support** — This revenue is recycled into **$GAME Catalyst tokens**, which flow back to the community and projects.

## 🌍 Who Benefits from Catalyst?

- **Ecosystem Projects** — Receive Catalyst tokens as liquidity support for growth.  
- **Arc Ambassadors** — Funded through [the Ambassador Program](/docs/content-creators/ambassador-program.mdx), rewarding community members for contributions.  
- **Players** — Can play Arc games like <a href={RUNEREALM.website} target="_blank">RuneRealm Onchain</a> to earn $GAME, which fuels more Catalyst liquidity.

## ♻️ Shared Redemption Model

Whether you’re a project, ambassador, or player, **Catalyst tokens are always hedged** (½ $GAME, ½ pair).  
At any time, holders can **redeem Catalyst tokens** back into the underlying LP tokens.  

This makes Catalyst positions more balanced, reducing one-sided risk while keeping liquidity strong.

---

## 🎮 Why It Matters

- **Sustainable Liquidity** — Pools deepen as Catalyst revenue flows in.  
- **Aligned Incentives** — Builders, ambassadors, and players all share the same liquidity engine.  
- **Flexibility** — Catalyst tokens can always be unwrapped into the base LP tokens.
