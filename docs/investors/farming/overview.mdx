# Your GameFi Journey Starts Here ðŸŽ®

Before unlocking the **[$GAME Catalyst](/docs/investors/farming/yield-farming-game.mdx)**, there are two core mechanics to understand:  

- **[AMMs (Super Simple)](/defi/amms)** â€” the swap engines of DeFi, where math + pools replace order books.  
- **[Liquidity Providing (LP)](/defi/liquidity-providing)** â€” how you deposit tokens into AMMs to earn fees (and face risks like impermanent loss).  

Master these basics, and youâ€™ll be ready to take on the **[$GAME Catalyst](/docs/investors/farming/yield-farming-game.mdx)** â€” Arcâ€™s farming engine that rewards liquidity providers and powers the $GAME ecosystem.
