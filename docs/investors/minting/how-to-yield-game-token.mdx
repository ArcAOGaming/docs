## Start Here: Stake ETH/DAI or Hold AR

Before you can begin yielding $GAME tokens, you’ll need to meet one of the following prerequisites:

- 🔒 <a href={AO.mint} target="_blank">Stake your ETH or DAI via AO</a>  
- 💎 Simply hold AR tokens in your wallet

Either method qualifies you to delegate and start earning rewards.
