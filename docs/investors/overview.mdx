# 🎮 3 Ways to Power Up in the Arc $GAME Ecosystem

Whether you’re just getting started or diving deep into DeFi, the Arc $GAME ecosystem offers **three distinct investment paths** — ranked from easiest to most advanced.

---

## 🥇 1. Minting & Delegation — *The Passive Path*

**Best for:** Set-it-and-forget-it investors

All you need to do is stake **ETH or DAI**, or simply **hold AR tokens** in your wallet. Then delegate to ArcAO and start passively **yielding $GAME tokens**.

## 🥈 2. Bridging & Buying — *The Power Move*

**Best for:** Users moving capital into AO's native environment

Choose from three bridge options to move assets like **USDC, AR, or DAI** into AO. Then swap into $GAME on AO-native DEXs.

## 🥉 3. $GAME Catalyst — *The GameFi Engine*

**Best for:** Yield-maximizers and ecosystem supporters

Catalyst tokens are LP-backed positions in pools like **Permaswap** and **Botega**. They generate yield, and auto-buybacks from Arc games recycle value back into $GAME.
